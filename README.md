## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Hello! I am a software developer driven by a deep passion for building machine learning (ML)-based applications that solve real-world problems and enhance technological capabilities. My expertise lies in classical machine learning algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering, which I have utilized to analyze data, uncover patterns, and make predictions effectively.

âœ¨I enjoy working with popular technologies such as Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn and Pandas, which I use to implement robust and efficient ML solutions. These tools enable me to develop, train, and deploy machine learning models with precision, ensuring high performance and scalability.

ðŸŒ±Beyond classical ML, I am currently delving into the cutting-edge field of generative AI, where I am exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI agents. These advanced AI methodologies have immense potential for transforming industries by enabling innovative solutions like conversational AI, intelligent search systems, and autonomous decision-making agents.

âš¡I enjoy learning new skills , staying at the forefront of technology and continuously expanding my skillset to contribute to the development of impactful AI systems.
