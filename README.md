## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am a software developer with a passion for creating machine learning-based applications. My expertise includes ML algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to develop advanced AI systems.

I enjoy working with technologies like Python, PyTorch, and Pandas, and I am currently exploring the exciting field of generative AI, including LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and intelligent agents.
